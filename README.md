Even more information:

- Alternatives:
  - [The original REAPER JSFX extension on which this is based](https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=173289). It doesn’t have as many features (for example, track priorities), and is more prone to bugs because it relies on inter-plugin communication. But it’s easier to setup for simple cases and it supports projects with massive numbers of tracks, while this modification is limited by the 64 channels per track that REAPER offers.
  - [TBProAudio’s AMM Automatic Microphone Mixer](https://www.tb-software.com/TBProAudio/amm.html). It’s limited to 16 stereo tracks and requires a setup with transmitters and receiver plugin instances, which limits the possibility of having independent groups of automixed tracks.
  - [WTAUTOMIXER](https://www.wtautomixer.com).
  - [Waves Dan Dugan Automixer Plugin](https://www.waves.com/plugins/dugan-automixer). This only works on Waves MultiRack system, not as a regular audio plugin.
- Papers on Automixers:
  - [Real-Time Multi-Track Mixing For Live Performance](https://zenodo.org/record/2550903#.X43irC9h01I).
  - [Automatic Microphone Mixer White Paper](https://jp.yamaha.com/files/download/other_assets/7/329527/Automixer_WhitePaper_en.pdf).
  - [The original patent](https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=US&NR=3992584A&KC=A&FT=D&ND=&date=19761116&DB=&locale=en_EP). This patent has expired, and since then the Automixer is also known as a **gain sharing algorithm**.

Bug in Scripts/leafac_Explode multistream (multitrack) media file to new one-stream (one-track) media files.lua:
Streams may be something other than video or audio. They may also be subtitles, attachments (data), and so forth. Right now, the script will try to treat them as audio and crash. These other streams should probably be ignored. (Report back to Ockenden)





Image to MIDI conversion


Maybe multichannel is bad because it affects Sidechains for later plugins
Test what denormalization is doing: adding noise (like dither) or a fixed small value (like ReEQ)
On rms, don’t compute the root and convert to db directly
Generate pink noise with stochastic model: inverse fft of magnitude with 3db slope and random phase
Waveform visualizer for any plug-in (just sandwich)
Yin
Plugin doctor
Idea of how to make circular buffers faster: have a notion of item size, so that you can store structs directly and cut one memory dereference
Idea pf optmization for rms: dont store the size, store its reciprocal, so that a division turns into a multiplication 
just call getchar so that mouse modifiers work
Digital hardware (like lexicon) has adc and dac. So if you have several in the chain, doesn’t it mean a lot of latency? What about modular synths?

Controlling REAPER with AutoHotkey

- [ ] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipL7H02G8bs&lc=UgzfLHisYi3GLBVVCUl4AaABAg


- [ ] OBS ↔ REAPER
    - [ ] Abort recording & pre-roll & stuff: https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?p=2455092#post2455092


REAPER ↔ OBS

- [ ] Abort recording: https://forum.cockos.com/showpost.php?p=2430380&postcount=29
- [ ] Don’t show user-generated values in GetUserInputs, use ShowConsoleMsg instead
    - [ ] You would need to add a short reference to the console-window in the title of GetUserInputs, so blind people know, there's a second window to look for additional information.
- [ ] Use Mespotine’s scripts
- [ ] LTC
    - [ ] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4R4wlfKdcw&lc=UgxRZeB539r1oGd__lt4AaABAg
- [ ] Add better error messages:
    - [ ] When OBS isn’t running
    - [ ] When you’re already recording and try to start
    - [ ] When you’re not recording and try to stop
    - [ ] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxfM4ftB1hM&lc=UgyzzfiAV-l2CMDhUF14AaABAg

- [ ] Add YouTube links to ReaScripts


JSFX

- [ ] Ping-pong delay
- [ ] Detect chords
- [ ] Blow air into mic game
- [ ] Flappy bird game (Flappy Square)
- [ ] Airwindows: Convert to JSFX: Spiral or Mojo
- Focus, an all-in-one distortion suite that includes, among others, the Spiral and Mojo algorithms (you may also try Distortion, which is pretty similar except without the frequency selection)
- PurestGain, as JSFX's ability to type exact values would work wonders on this
- Preponderant, a plugin that does the opposite of popular resonance-removing plugins like Soothe, TEOTE and the freeware Vastaus (we need to implement an "Inverse" function in the Dry/Wet just like in other Airwindows plugins, so it does actually function as a Soothe-like plugin)
- DeBess, as it is an excellent de-esser but its structure may not be easy to understand for beginners (same with Pressure4)
- Infinity2 (so you can kill the feedback with a button instead of dragging the Feedback fader to the left)
- CStrip may be good for JSFX, and I'd like to try its TimeLag function with exact values
Fotis Ky <seethisworld@gmail.com>


- [ ] Control dry/wet depending on gain (think about how reverb works in a hall: louder means more reverb)
- [ ] Fernando Imperator (https://twitter.com/imperat) Feature idea: If you ever develop a version that instead of rendering the multicam video, just creates an XML to import to Adobe Premiere or DaVinci, it'd be awesome.

    - [ ] ReaScript to set up tracks & dedicated video processor item
    - [ ] Add support for clicking on thumbnails in preview to switch to another scene
    - [ ] When switching with ReaScript if you didn’t select items, look for an item under the cursor (and maybe even if you did select items, really)

            - [ ] Good because it puts together things that belong together
            - [ ] Bad because it doesn’t work with dynamically allocated structures (for example, one circular buffer per channel)
        - [ ] Arrays with fixed positions (for example, my_object[field_index], my_multi_dimensional_array[index_x][index_y])
        - [ ] Functions that calculate indexes (for example, my_multi_dimensional_array[my_multi_dimensional_array_index(x, y, width, height)]
            - [ ] Good because multiplication is faster than multiple memory lookups of the technique above
            - [ ] Bad because it’s more cumbersome to use (you have to keep repeating the width and height, but it may be a good thing to avoid out-of-bounds errors)

- [ ] Other topics to cover:
    - [ ] Even when you’re clipping in the middle of a FX chain, or in a channel, there’s a chance that you won’t clip in the end, of somewhere in the pipeline there’s another thing that brings the gain down
        - [ ] That works because internally REAPER (and many other DAWs) use 64 bits per sample, as opposed to the 16/24/32 that you’d find in other places
        - [ ] But it’s generally a bad idea to rely on this, because some effects don’t work as well when the input is clipping

 The first idea is a script that would open a dialog box in REAPER. In the dialogue box, you can enter a shortcut or simply paste a command ID, and in the first case, it would look for the command ID with that shortcut assigned to it, and in the second case it would just use the ID to generate a smart marker at edit cursor position. Currently there is an outboarder script that allows making a custom name and color marker, but all the modifications needs to be done by duplicating the script and editing values in the IDE, so I thought It'd be cool if there was a way of to have a dialog box basically kinda fill in those strings. That way it could be a hotkey or toolbar icon and it would quickly generate a bunch of action markers even by hotkey inputs.

  It would be nice if there was a script in REAPER that would generate an ADR script from a list of item names. The studio I used to work in had a similar setup for Pro Tools, where you would make clip regions, and then export a text file from Pro Tools. It would have the start timecode and the name of the clip region, which you would then paste into an excel sheet, and it would generate a script based on that. I'll have to dig it up but basically let me know if any of this sounds like something you'd be interested in and we can keep communicating from there!


   Basically it would be an action to write the volume/pan/pitch envelope of a track onto the items that are on the track. It's really useful in films cuz the sound editor usually doesn't do automation and the mixer does, so with this script, the sound designer can mix their own reaper project, and then in the end just write all of the automation to the items, and they can then just clear all the track envelopes and the project is ready to mix. 

 It'll be useful for other people too cuz track envelopes have a lot more features overall, like latch preview (items have them but they're a pain and again, way fewer actions to toggle them etc.) and also track envelopes are more straightforward to assign to midi controllers than items (speaking of which, action to assign midi cc to "selected items volume" is useful too and I think that one doesn't exist either) but then writing all that to the item frees up the envelope lanes once again, and also items can then be freely position across tracks.

-- [[ GUI-element-functions ]]

-- here come the GUI-element functions. If you want to add another GUI-element into the preferences, just use one of these
-- functions to do it.
-- For those elements who can store stuff, you can set a section and key, into which the settings will be stored.
-- They are then stored as ExtStates using SetExtState. To retrieve these settings, use GetExtState in your script.
-- As "section" I used "LeaFac_OBS", and as key the name of the setting.
-- Set some of the values and have a look into reaper-extstate.ini to see, how this looks like. You quickly get the idea.
--
-- Important: it will NOT store them, when nothing has been clicked. So you need to have default-values in your
--            script, in case the user hasn't set any settings yet(in that case, GetExtState returns ""
--            The values returned by GetExtState are always strings, so integers and such must be converted

-- Also an explanation of the parameters.
